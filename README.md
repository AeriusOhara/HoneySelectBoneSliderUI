# Usage
Once you open the application, please make sure the minimum and maximum value of sliders are set to your liking. They are by default set between 0.0 as minimum to 2.0 as maximum. You can use the button on the right to load up a .bonemod.txt file.

Once loaded the window will be populated with a table that has many rows. The columns contain the following information from left to right: Bone Name, True/False toggle (checkmark=True), X Scale Slider, Y Scale Slider, Z Scale Slider and Bone Length Slider.

Each step that any slider is moved will save the file with the new value, this way you can see the changes in real-time. Enabling or Disabling a checkbox also saves the file, so you can enable/disable bones as you go.
